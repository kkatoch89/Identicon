# Identicon

## Goal
To generate an itenticon

## Criteria
-An identicon is a 250px square made up of a 5x5 grid of squares, each 50 px tall and wide
-Identicon are always mirrored along the center vertical axis
-Each Identicon should not be randomly generated. They are generated based on a string input, so each specific string should consistently generate the exact same identicon
